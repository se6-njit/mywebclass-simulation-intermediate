# User Story: Automated Quality Control


## Description

As a backend developer, I want to ensure that my code is of high quality and meets the defined coding standards. This user story involves implementing automated quality control checks on the backend code to identify issues and enforce coding standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Automated quality control checks are implemented on the backend code
- The quality control checks include linting, code formatting, and security scanning
- The quality control checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
- The quality control checks are executed automatically on every code push
- If the quality control checks fail, the pipeline should fail and notify the developer of the issues
- The quality control checks should be configurable to allow for customization of rules and standards

## Task(s)

# User Story: Automate Deployment Pipeline

## Description
As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate the deployment pipeline for our applications, so that we can reduce the time it takes to deploy and release changes, and ensure that our releases are consistent and error-free.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The deployment pipeline must be automated using a CI/CD tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI.
- The pipeline should include the following stages: build, test, deploy, and release.
- The pipeline should include automated tests for each stage of the pipeline to ensure that changes are validated before deployment.
- The pipeline should be version-controlled using a tool such as Git, so that changes can be tracked and rolled back if necessary.

## Task(s)

- [CI/CD Implementation](./tasks/CI-CD_pipeline_implmention.md)

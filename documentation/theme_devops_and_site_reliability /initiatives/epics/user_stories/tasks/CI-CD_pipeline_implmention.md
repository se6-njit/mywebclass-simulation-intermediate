# Task: Implement CI/CD Pipeline

## User Story:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process and ensure that any changes to the codebase are thoroughly tested before they are released to production.

## Description:
The task involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and configuring it to automatically build and test the application every time there is a new commit to the codebase. The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application to the staging environment. It should also integrate with version control and artifact repositories to ensure that the correct version of the code is deployed to the staging environment.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is implemented and configured according to the requirements
- The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application to the staging environment
- The pipeline should integrate with version control and artifact repositories
- The pipeline should be triggered automatically on every commit to the codebase
- All changes to the codebase should be thoroughly tested before they are released to production

## Effort Estimate: 4-6 weeks

## Assigned To: Ebram Mekhail

## Priority: High

## Status: Done

## Notes:
- The pipeline should also include integration and functional testing stages
- The pipeline should be designed to easily deploy to multiple environments such as development, staging and production.

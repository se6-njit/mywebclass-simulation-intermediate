# Backend Testing Task: Develop Test Suite for Login Feature

## User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to login to the system using my credentials so that I can access my account information.

## Description:
Develop a test suite for the login feature that covers both positive and negative scenarios, including testing for invalid usernames and passwords, testing for successful login, and testing for security measures like account lockouts.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- All tests should pass
- Code coverage for the login feature should be at least 80%
- Tests should be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## Effort Estimate: 16 hours

## Assigned To: Ebram Mekhail

## Priority: High

## Status: Done
## Notes:
- Additional requirements for the test suite may be added in the future as the login feature is expanded or modified.

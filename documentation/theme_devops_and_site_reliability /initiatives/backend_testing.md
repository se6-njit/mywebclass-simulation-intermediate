# Initiative: Backend Testing

## Description
Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for backend testing using Artillery and Playwright. This strategy should include the evaluation of the Oracle server, Next.js, and CSS frameworks. The strategy should also include the creation of automated tests to ensure continuous testing.

## Goals
- Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for backend testing.
- Evaluate the Oracle server, Next.js, and CSS frameworks.
- Create automated tests to ensure continuous testing.

## Scope
- Test the Oracle server with Artillery and Playwright.
- Evaluate Next.js and each of the CSS frameworks.
- Develop automated tests for continuous testing.

## Outcomes
- Comprehensive testing strategy for backend testing.
- Evaluation of the Oracle server, Next.js, and CSS frameworks.
- Automated tests for continuous testing.

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive testing strategy document.
- Automated test suite for continuous testing.

## Milestones
- Complete testing strategy document: 2 weeks
- Evaluate Oracle server, Next.js, and CSS frameworks: 4 weeks
- Develop automated test suite: 6 weeks

## Constraints
- Limited resources for testing and evaluation.
- Limited knowledge of Artillery and Playwright.

## Assumptions
- Artillery and Playwright are suitable for testing the Oracle server.
- Oracle server, Next.js, and CSS frameworks are critical components of the project.

## Risks
- Testing and evaluation may uncover critical issues with the Oracle server or CSS frameworks.
- Automated tests may be complex and difficult to implement.

## Dependencies
- Availability of resources for testing and evaluation.
- Availability of developers to develop and implement automated tests.

# Theme: Product Development, Security and Testing
## Overview
Our product development plan consists of three main areas: front-end testing, development tasks, and security measures. Each area is designed to improve the user experience, ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and enhance the security of our website.To ensure the best possible user experience, we will conduct front-end testing using three different CSS frameworks and plain HTML and CSS. We will also compare the performance of Next.js with the CSS frameworks and static pages. Using Playwright, we will automate browser testing of the homepage, content page, and story, and measure key metrics such as page load time, accessibility score, best practices score, FCP, TTI, TBT, CLS, page size, number of requests, bundle size, and overall size. We will also research industry statistics for each metric to benchmark our performance. To ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, we will conduct legal research and implement necessary changes, perform testing, and resolve any issues that arise. We will also implement internationalization features to make our website accessible to users from different countries and cultures, and conduct SEO research to improve our website's visibility and ranking on search engines. Additionally, we will conduct web accessibility research and implement changes to ensure our website is accessible to users with disabilities. To improve the visual appeal and navigability of our website on different devices, we will develop a responsive content template and homepage. Finally, we will implement GDPR requirements with Google Analytics using Consent API and Javascript to comply with relevant data privacy regulations. To enhance the security of our website, we will implement SSL/TLS encryption to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. We will also regularly update our software and plugins, perform vulnerability scans, and conduct security audits to identify and address any potential security risks. Overall, our product development plan aims to deliver a high-quality, user-friendly, and secure website that complies with relevant laws and regulations and meets the needs of our customers.

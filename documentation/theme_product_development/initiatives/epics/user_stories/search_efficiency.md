# Search Efficiency
## Description
As a user, I want to filter search results by date range so that I can easily find recently published content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The search results page displays a date range filter option, which allows the user to select a specific date range for the search results.
- The date range filter option should be prominently displayed and easy to use.
- When the user selects a date range, the search results page should update to display only the content that was published within the selected date range.
- The date range filter option should be available on all pages of the website where search is available.

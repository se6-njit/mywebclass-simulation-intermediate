# Multilingual Feature
## Description
As a user, I want to be able to switch between different languages on the website so that I can read the content in my preferred language.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- A language selector dropdown menu is available on the website's header or footer.
- The language selector displays all available languages for the website.
- When the user selects a language, the website content updates to display in the selected language.
- The selected language preference is stored in the user's session, so the website remembers the language choice for future visits.
- If the website content is not available in the selected language, a default language (usually English) is displayed.
- The language selector is available on all pages of the website, so the user can change the language at any time.

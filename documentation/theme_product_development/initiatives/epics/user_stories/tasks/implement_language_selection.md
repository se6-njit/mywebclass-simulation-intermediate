## Task Title: Implement Language Selection Functionality

### User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to select my preferred language on the website, so that I can read the website content in my preferred language.

### Description:
To meet the user's needs, the task requires implementing language selection functionality on the website. This can be achieved by using a localization framework or library such as i18next or by implementing the functionality within the website code itself. The acceptance criteria for this task include:

- The website should provide a list of supported languages for the user to choose from
- When a user selects a language, the website content should update to display in the selected language
- All the website content, including static text and dynamic content, should be translated into the selected language
- The language selection should be persistent across page refreshes and sessions

Dependencies for this task may include any necessary updates or modifications to the website code or content, as well as the installation and configuration of any necessary localization frameworks or libraries. The task should be assigned to a team member with experience in web development and localization, and the estimated effort required for completing the task is 15 hours.

### Status:

### Notes:
It is important to ensure that the translation is accurate and culturally appropriate for the selected language. The website should provide a way for users to report any translation errors or issues. Additionally, the website should be designed with localization in mind, such as using variable placeholders instead of hard-coded text to make translation easier.

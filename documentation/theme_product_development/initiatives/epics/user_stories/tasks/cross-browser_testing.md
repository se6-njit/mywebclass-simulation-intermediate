## Task Title: Implement Cross-Browser Testing for Automation Tool

### User Story:
As an automation tester, I want the automation tool to be able to execute tests on multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, so that we can ensure the compatibility of our application with different browsers.

### Description:
To meet the user's needs, the task requires implementing cross-browser testing functionality for the automation tool. This can be achieved by using a cross-browser testing tool such as Selenium Grid, or by implementing the functionality within the automation tool itself. The acceptance criteria for this task include:

- The automation tool is able to execute tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
- Test scripts are executed with the same consistency and accuracy across all the browsers
- The test results should be easily accessible and should provide browser-specific information
- The tool should be easy to set up and use for cross-browser testing

Dependencies for this task may include any necessary updates or modifications to the automation tool, as well as the installation and configuration of any necessary drivers or plugins. The task should be assigned to a team member with experience in cross-browser testing and automation testing, and the estimated effort required for completing the task is 20 hours.

### Effort Estimate:
20 hours

### Assigned To:
[Insert name of team member responsible for completing the task]

### Priority:
High

### Status:
Not started

### Notes:
It is important to test the application on different browsers to ensure that it works consistently across different platforms. The cross-browser testing tool or framework used should be compatible with the programming language used for test automation. Additionally, the tool should be able to handle parallel execution of tests on multiple browsers for efficient testing.

## User Story
As a quality assurance engineer, I want to automate browser testing to ensure consistent performance across different browsers and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The automation tool should be able to execute tests on multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- The automation tool should also be able to execute tests on multiple devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- The tests should cover different scenarios such as page load times, responsiveness, and compatibility with different screen sizes.
- The automation tool should be integrated with the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically run the tests after each deployment.
- The test results should be logged and easily accessible, allowing the QA team to identify and investigate any issues.
- The automation tool should be scalable, allowing the QA team to add or modify tests as needed without significant changes to the existing setup.

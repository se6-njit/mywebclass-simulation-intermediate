# Project Start - Sprint 1 Team Management

## Handling Skill Conflicts

During the meeting to plan the first sprint of the project, it becomes apparent
that two team members – Ebram and Aryan – have very similar skills in front-end
development. They both have strong front-end development skills and aren't sure
how to divide the work. Stephen (the project manager) acknowledges that having
two people with the same skill set can be a challenge, and suggests that they
take a collaborative approach and work together to build the front-end, with
Aryan taking on the role of a Front-end Developer and Ebram serving as the QA.

Aryan will be responsible for writing the code and making design decisions,
while Ebram will test the front-end to make sure that everything works as
expected. This division of labor will allow them to make the most of their
skills and ensure that the front-end is of high quality. Now, they both feel
better knowing that they have a clear plan for how to approach the front-end
development and are eager to get started.

  members who have different levels of technical knowledge. Communication
  challenges can arise if there are misunderstandings or if expectations are not
  clearly defined.
- Client requirements can change during the development process, which can cause
  delays and require significant changes to the codebase.
- Web developers must be vigilant about security threats such as hacking, data
  breaches, and malware.

- Developers must stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques to remain
  competitive and provide the best solutions for their clients.

## NOTE:

This is only a part of the entire assignment for team management. My team and I
have also submitted the document on canvas; we wanted to add markdown file here
as well to have some documentation about our team.
